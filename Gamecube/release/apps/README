QUICK USAGE:
 * ISOs can be .bin/.cue (Make sure .cue contains _relative_ directory!), .img, or .iso format
 * To install: Extract the contents of WiiSXRX.zip to the root of your SD card
 * For SD/USB: Put ISOs (.bin/.cue or other formats) in the directory named /wiisxrx/isos,
    All Memory Cards will automatically be placed in /wiisxrx/saves
	All Savestates will automatically be placed in /wiisxrx/savestates
 * For DVD: ISOs may be anywhere on the disc (requires DVDxV2 on Wii)
 * For actual BIOS: Put SCPH1001.BIN in the directory on SD/USB named /wiisxrx/bios
 * Load the executable from the HBC or in the loader of your choice
    Once loaded, select 'Load ISO' and choose the source and select the ISO to load
		(Note: to go up a directory select '..', B will exit the file browser)
 * Select 'Play Game' to play
   The game can be exited any time by pressing a configurable key combination together 
   on a GC pad (START & X), Wii Classic Controller or Pro (HOME), Wiimote (- & +),
   Wii U Pro Controller (HOME), or Wii U Gamepad (HOME)
   Wiimote+Nunchuck (1 & 2), or the reset button
		(Note: this must be done to save your game; it will not be done automatically)

Controls:
 * While the Gamecube pad is compatible, a Wii Classic Controller, Wii Classic Controller Pro, or Wii U Pro Controller is recommended.
 * The Wii U Gamepad is also compatible, but only when doing Wii U injections (no, you can't use it on vWii).
 * Controls are now fully configurable so any button on your controller can be mapped
 * The controller configuration screen presents each PSX button and allows you to toggle through sources
 * There are 4 configuration slots for each type of controller
   * To load a different, previously saved configuration, select the slot, and click 'Load'
   * After configuring the controls as desired, select the slot, and click 'Save'
   * After saving different configurations to the slots, be sure to save your configs in the input tab of the settings frame
 * Clicking 'Next Pad' will cycle through the PSX controllers assigned
 * There is an option to invert the Y axis of the PSX's analog sticks; by default this is 'Normal Y'
 * The 'Menu Combo' configuration allows you to select a button combination to return to the menu
